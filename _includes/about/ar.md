Welcome to Sweet Solutions, the blog dedicated to providing technical solutions for your z/OS modernization journey. I'm Anthony Randolph.

I have been an IBMer for 20+ years ... and have had an opportunity to be apart of many roles here. Starting in SAP security, I was a part of a team that created an automation solution for very successful SAP migration in my early tenure. Since then I've been hooked on using automation to enable stakeholders and increase productivity and throughput. For most of my career I've been a Java developer and focused on automating task for internal and external stakeholders. I've been fortunate to be able to create several solutions for z/OS application development use-cases. Over the years I have developed an approach to development and automation in which I cover as many scenarios/user paths as possible.

As apart of my career's journey I've had stints in QA, Development and as a L2/L3 Support Engineer. My role as a Support Engineer, all be it brief, definitely reset my perspective as a developer... it helped me to design/code solutions with the customer in mind because I understand some of the customers pain points. 

In my current role as the IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack - Solution Enablement lead two of of my teams many objectives is to be the first customer to ensure customer experience with the stack is as painless as possible and verify that the components of the stack integrate and work as a solution. So many of the solutions I will share will be born out of the need for my team to complete these objectives. Tha being said I would have to say, one of the most rewarding objective is working with my team to create automated solutions that enable our team and other stakeholders the ability to manage resources of the stack ... A such, my goal with this blog will be to provide insights into using these solutions and related technologies we create.

In addition to my love for technology I am a seasoned home cook and semi-professional baker and as such I am hoping to bring _`solution recipes`_ to provide samples and technology to solve real problems. The solutions provided in my posts will engage and assist stakeholders in their day-to-day deployment of IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack and related technologies. I look forward to engaging with various stakeholders and collaborating to enhance their z/OS modernization journeys.

As an avid z/OS developer and open source enthusiast, I bridge the gap between these two realms, bringing you the best of both worlds. With a deep understanding of mainframe technologies and a passion for exploring open-source innovations, I strive to demystify the complexities surrounding mainframe development.

I've had the opportunity to tackle Node.js and Swift on z/OS to diving into emerging open-source tools, I thrive on combining cutting-edge techniques with the robustness of the mainframe platform.

My journey has led me to contribute actively to the z/OS Open Source project on GitHub. By integrating the latest open-source technologies with z/OS, I enable developers to leverage powerful tools that were previously reserved for other platforms. Through my work, I aim to break down the barriers that often hinder mainframe developers from accessing the full potential of open source.

Solving complex challenges is the beating heart of my work. Whether it's optimizing mainframe performance, enhancing system security, or streamlining development processes, I relentlessly seek innovative solutions. By demystifying these intricate topics, I empower fellow mainframe enthusiasts to unlock new possibilities and push the boundaries of what can be achieved in the mainframe realm.

Mainframe Demystified is not just a blog; it's a community. I actively engage with other developers, both within the mainframe ecosystem and the wider open-source community. Through conferences, meetups, and online forums, I foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, because I believe that together we can achieve more and propel the mainframe world forward.
Thank you for being a part of Mainframe Demystified, and I look forward to the enlightening journey ahead!

Welcome to Sweet Solutions, the blog dedicated to providing technical solutions for your z/OS modernization journey. I'm Anthony Randolph.

I have been an IBMer for 20+ years ... and have had an opportunity to be apart of many roles here. Starting in SAP security, I was a part of a team that created an automation solution for very successful SAP migration in my early tenure. Since then I've been hooked on using automation to enable stakeholders and increase productivity and throughput. For most of my career I've been a Java developer and focused on automating task for internal and external stakeholders. I've been fortunate to be able to create several solutions for z/OS application development use-cases. Over the years I have developed an approach to development and automation in which I cover as many scenarios/user paths as possible.

As apart of my career's journey I've had stints in QA, Development and as a L2/L3 Support Engineer. My role as a Support Engineer, all be it brief, definitely reset my perspective as a developer... it helped me to design/code solutions with the customer in mind because I understand some of the customers pain points. 

In my current role as the IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack - Solution Enablement lead some of my teams major objectives is to be the first customer to ensure customer experience with the stack is as painless as possible and verify that the components of the stack integrate and work as a solution. As such, many of the solutions I will share will be born out of the need for my team to complete these objectives. One of the most rewarding outcomes in my pursuit of these objectives has been working with my team to create automated solutions that enable our team and other stakeholders. Providing stakeholders the ability to manage resources of the stack. As such, my goal with this blog will be to provide insights into using these solutions and related technologies.

In addition to my love for technology I am a seasoned home cook and semi-professional baker and intend to bring _`solution recipes`_ to provide samples and technology to solve real problems. The solutions provided in my posts will engage and assist stakeholders in their day-to-day deployment of IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack and related technologies. I look forward to engaging with various stakeholders and collaborating to enhance their z/OS modernization journeys.
